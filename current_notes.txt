- seperate the procedural noise generator into a different class or function for cleanliness 
- implement the summed area table algorithm in order to find the largest landmass (can be multiple land masses)
- it is a dynamic programming solution that fits pretty much all requirements
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table

- need to modify or override the noise library to accomodate this. 
- probably make it build the sum table at the same time as the noise map. Less computations required, because it would just be adding up the previous stored value.
- current idea is to create a new builder type, that accomodates this idea.



- implement a 3d voxel generation system where the voxels follows the pattern of the map
- implement a skin system that takes the voxels and turns it into a full 3d map


- Dwarf fortress has a rng based society where the culture develops from player decsisions
